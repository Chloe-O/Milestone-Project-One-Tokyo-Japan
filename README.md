###Short Guide to Tokyo, Japan
For the project I decided to write a short and concise guide to some of the food and sites in Tokyo, based on my own trip to the city.
UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

The website is aimed at those visiting Tokyo for a short amount of time and are particularly focused on some quintessential sites and foods.
I wanted the site to look light, clean and minimal to avoid a cluttered feeling when visiting. The site follows a rough colour scheme of white, blue and grey with circular images throughout the pages.
For those looking for quick recommendations, it’s easy to find sites and foods listed on the site with quite concise descriptions
I have included hyperlinks for some of the suggestions(opening in a new tab) so visitors can find out more information about a particular site or food if they wish without cluttering the site
The navigation bar offers links to each page, this is present on each page for ease of navigation
I have made use of ID’s on the Sites & Food pages so visitors can jump to a specific food or attraction without having to scroll, there are also ‘back to the top’ buttons at the bottom of these pages
I have included a basic wireframe to show my idea for the site before building

When testing the site, I utilised Google’s Developer Tools and looked at the responsiveness of the site across many mobile device sizes

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
